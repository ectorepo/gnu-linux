It's difficult to determine what should be in this manifest and what should not.
There are already [planned] manifests for KDE, Garuda, the Linux Kernel and
other related projects/categories. This issue itself is similar to the ontological issues resolved by SPDX, OWL and RDF described below.

What is in Linux that is clearly not better categorized as part of:

+ Linux kernel development?
+ A specific distribution?
+ A Window Manager or Desktop Environment?
+ X11 or Wayland?
+ Essential GNU software tools?

What makes the most sense is to define this repo as containing the last
category, plus anything that isn't readily contained within the others while
also being considered a staple of Linux distributions. For now, I may include
information about some alternatives to the Linux kernel or in the traditional
Linux ecosystem, generally, before splitting that off.

Eventually everything could move, as the GNU tools themselves have alternatives:
whether one-to-one replacements (posix compatible) or tools whose usage/API
overlaps with established needs for computering systems or tools that could
invalidate those needs entirely.

** SPDX

3.0 is the first ISO version of SPDX. It codifies a working ontology within
which software packages can be completely modeled. SPDX bundles information that
conveys:

+ Components of a software package
+ Tracking of software package provenance
+ Licensing of the package and its components (enabling validation)

+ SPDX :: Software Package Data Exchange
  - [[https://spdx.org/rdf/ontology/spdx-2-2/][SPDX spec]] definied defined with RDF ontology modeling
  - Interesting SPDX docs:
    + 3 [[https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3-draft/terms-and-definitions/][Terms and Definitions]]
    + 5 [[https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3-draft/composition-of-an-SPDX-document/][Composition of an SPDX Document]]
    + 9 [[https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3-draft/snippet-information/][Snippet Information]]
    + 7 [[https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3-draft/package-information/][Package information]]
    + 11 [[https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3-draft/relationships-between-SPDX-elements/][Relationships between SPDX elements]]
    + The appendices are also useful

+ RDF :: W3C's Resource Description Framework
  - see the repo [[https://github.com/w3c/EasierRDF][w3c/easierRDF]] for clearer descriptions
+ OWL :: W3C's [[https://www.w3.org/OWL/][Web Ontology Language]]
